I.An overview of the class hierarchy:

Top Entity:         cmdCenter
                        |    
	             stghold          
	            /       \
               scout         cache
	                    /     \
		      weapon      decoder

(The above classes under cmdCenter are all nested class)


		        replacer
		 |      |      |    |
	       FIFO    NMRU   LRU  RND
(The above classes under replacer are all child classes)

cmdCenter is in cmdCenter.h header file
stghold and scout are in stghold.h header file
cache, weapon, and decoder are in cache.h header file
replacer is in replacer.h header file

NOTE: -Some of the implementation of cmdCenter methods
      will be found in cmdCenter.cpp
      -Some of the implementation of cache methods
      will be found in cache.cpp
II. cmdCenter
This is the top level class, we will invoke methods
in this class when we write our main functions.

field:
 -level_1 (pointer to stghold class)
 -level_2 (pointer to stghold class)
 You can think of the above as places where to hold
 LV_1 and LV_2 caches
 
 -vector<string> allAdddr (We read every line in our
 test file and store each line into a bucket of vector
 allAddr for further process)

 -InstnFetch (number of InstnFetch)
 -InstnMiss  (number of Instruction Fetch Miss)
 -DatRdFetch (number of data read)
 -misc (invalid code,other than 0 1 2)

method:
 -constructor: it will create two new objects of type
 stghold in the heap and finish defining the  configu-
 ration of each level (LV1 and LV2)

 -reinStghold: this method will finish creating caches
 and updating cache information in each stghold

 -readAll: read all lines in test file and store each
 line into allAddr vector

 -addFetch: add corresponding fetch numbers according to code(code = 0, increment readData fetch by 1)

 -addMiss: add corresponding miss numbers according to
 code(code = 0, increment datRdMiss by 1)

 -getCode: get the code from "<code> <HexDecimal>"
 
 -read: "read from cache" operation, 
 (haven't completed)
 -access: preparation before accessing cache(increment corresponding fetch num),check level exists or not

 -decideOperation: decide operation of writing to
 cache or reading from  cache

 -simulate: call access method upon each line




III. stghold
stghold is a class used to create and hold cache objects

field:
 -config // is this level of cache SPLIT or UNIFIED?
 -wareHouse // an array of pointers, whose element is
 pointer to cache object. (I design like this because
 we don't know how many caches are there in this level
 if SPLIT then one DATA cache and one INSTRUCTION cache
 if UNIFIED thsn just one MIXED cache, otherwise no
 cache)

method:
 -decideConfig() //ask user about the configuration of
 this level

 -scoutDispatch //ask user about all the information
 we need to create an cache(Capacity/Block Size...)
 
 -createWareHouse //according to configuration create
 correcct number of places to hold cache and create
 caches with correct type, size, repPolicy according
 to information given by user

 -maybe more



IV. scout
You can think of this as a temporary object, its
purpose is to ask cache information from user and
run to stghold to report that information and then it
sadly dies.

field:
 - cap  //capacity of cache
 - bsize //block size of cache
 - assoc //associatitity 
 - rep  //replacement policy
 -wralloc //if write allocation or not

method:
 -no method.   happy ? :) 

V. cache
Finally we come to the real cache object, you know what it does.

field:
 - set
 - way
 - rep  //replacement policy
 - blockSize 
 - wralloc //write allocation or not
 - repPolicy //a pointer pointing at an object of type
               replacer
             (NOTE: I use polymorphism here because we
	            will need dynamic dispatch)
 - readCache //read from cache, still implementing
 - writeChace //write from cache, still implementing
method:
 - constructor: according to information given by
 scout, we calculate set and way for this cache,
 set replacement policy correctly and create our table
 (wpRecorder) to hold weapons(tag,dirty bit, valid)

 - getWay: if user input "n way associative" we need
 to extract n from this input and transform it into
 int way

 - createReplacer: according to different replacement
 policy, we create objects of type child classes
 and return a pointer pointing at that object because
 the method to replace are all differrent.

VI. decoder

decoder is just a class used to decode information in
each line according to the cache we are now accessing,
so it should be a nested class inside of cache since
it is cache depended.


field:
 -index  //set num
 -tag    //tag value
 -cacheType  //mixed/unified/split(data/memory)
 -rORW   //is this a read or write?

method:
 -decodeAddr: A method used to decode address and fill
 in the fields of decoder with correct information



VII. weapon
A.K.A node to add into cache table, when we write something
into cache or have a read miss and bring something into cache

field:
 -isDirty
 -isValid
 -tag

method:
 -constructor: default constructor
 -constructor: customized costructor

VIII. replacer
 We've discussed about this in the morning, I think by
 now we all understand how this class work, the implementation
 of each child class can be found in replacer.h header
 file
