Major Part To Write:

write function in cmdCenter.cpp
writeCache function in cache.cpp
writeMiss function in cache.cpp
Output Interface
Destructor for all the classes
Copy Constructor for all the classes
Copy Assignment Operator for all the classes
(Rule of Three)

Test all the functions we have written so far to
make sure they work correctly





We have serveral small functions to write:
==================================================

XX
void replaceBlock(int set, int way, decoder & enigma)

This function should be a method inside of
cache class
What it does is to find the replace block(weapon)
overwrite its tag to enigma.tag
overwrite its addr to enigma.addr
overwrite its isDirty to 0
overwrite its isValid to 1

Its declaration is in cache.h
Please implement it in cache.cpp
==================================================

void cmdCenter::decideMemAccTime()
This is a method inside of cmdCenter class, it should
ask user for the main memory access time and store it
into field "memAccTime" inside of cmdCenter
Its declaration is in cmdCenter.h
Please implement it in cmdCenter.cpp

==================================================

XX

int tagComparator(int set, string tag)
This is a method inside of cache class. User passes in two arguments:
-First one specify a set to search
-Second one specify a tag to look for
This method should go into the specified set and compare every tag inside
of this set to the argument tag, if there is one tag that matches with it
this function returns an integer represents the location of that bucket. Otherwise it should return -1

The declaration of this method is in cache.h
The implementation of this method is in cache.cpp
=================================================




We also have some functions that need to be modified:

1.Add new feature to scoutDispatch function
  -Ask user for information of hitTime of this cache and store the result into "hitTime" field in scout class

XX
2. Modify getCode function
 -Cancel one extra operation: Do not discard the first character(the code 0 1 2) after extract it. keep the
 string invariant

XX
3.Modify decodeAddr function
 -This time when take an string of address, when decoding, notice that the first character (code) hasn't been discarded.








I know there is a lot of work to do :(

I just read one sentence today that I want to share with you:

The turning point in the process of growing up is
when you discover the core of strength within you
that survives all hurt.

A little bit sentimental, right? :|
